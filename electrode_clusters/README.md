I investigated the relationship between electrode clusters used to assess two factors of cognition, cue detection and intention retrieval, in predicting accuracy on a cognitive task using machine learning. I used cluster validation to perform clustering on the EEG signals from the two sets of electrode clusters, predictive modeling to train a model using the clusters to predict accuracy, and cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance.

The sample is likely not large enough to show accurate results, but it can be retested as more data is collected.

Currently, the resultssuggest that there are other factors besides the electrode connectivity, depression levels, and reaction time predicting cognitive accuracy.
